# Implementation Plan

This document describes the phased implementation of the Astral API. Each numbered section corresponds to a logical step in development (i.e., a milestone). Tasks within each section are listed as checkboxes with bulleted requirements that detail what needs to be achieved. The agent should update this document after completing each task, run tests/builds, and commit changes to the repository.

---

## 1. Initial Project Setup & Repository Bootstrap

- [ ] **Task 1.1: Repository Initialization**
  - • Create a new Git repository with a clear commit history.
  - • Set up the basic project structure (.cursor/rules/project-structure.md) (e.g., app/, tests/, docs/, config/, etc.) following the established directory design.
  - • Add standard configuration files (.gitignore, README.md, etc.).
- [ ] **Task 1.2: Environment & Dependency Setup**
  - • Configure the Python environment (.cursor/rules/python-environment.md) using Python 3.11.
  - • Define dependencies in `pyproject.toml` (include FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Pydantic, pytest, etc.).
  - • Set up pre-commit hooks (Black, isort, Flake8, mypy).
- [ ] **Task 1.3: CI/CD Pipeline Bootstrap**
  - • Create a basic GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests and linters on each push.
  - • Document CI/CD configuration in the repository.

---

## 2. Database Schema & Migrations

- [ ] **Task 2.1: Define Database Models**
  - • Create Pydantic and SQLAlchemy models for Users, Addresses, Location Proofs (Attestations), and Chains based on the Schema Design Document.
  - • Ensure relationships (foreign keys) are defined correctly.
- [ ] **Task 2.2: Set Up Database Migrations**
  - • Initialize Alembic for database migrations.
  - • Create an initial migration script to set up the database schema.
- [ ] **Task 2.3: Integration Testing for Database**
  - • Write integration tests for database operations (CRUD, relationships, etc.).
  - • Ensure tests run successfully in the CI environment.

---

## 3. API Development (REST Endpoints)

- [ ] **Task 3.1: Define API Routing Structure**
  - • Create a modular FastAPI routing structure under `app/components/` for endpoints (e.g., location proofs, authentication, health-check).
  - • Document endpoint specifications in the code and README.
- [ ] **Task 3.2: Implement Core Endpoints**
  - • Develop endpoints for querying and creating location proofs.
  - • Ensure OGC API – Features compliance for endpoints like `/collections` and `/collections/{collectionId}/items`.
- [ ] **Task 3.3: Error Handling & Validation**
  - • Implement error handling and input validation using Pydantic.
  - • Write unit tests for endpoint functionality.

---

## 4. Integration with EAS & Scheduler

- [ ] **Task 4.1: EAS Integration**
  - • Implement service functions in `app/services/eas_integration.py` to interact with the EAS GraphQL endpoint.
  - • Design these functions to parse and store attestations in the database.
- [ ] **Task 4.2: Scheduler for Regular EAS Polling**
  - • Create a scheduler in `app/services/scheduler.py` to periodically poll the EAS GraphQL endpoint.
  - • Allow configuration for polling frequency (e.g., every minute by default, and more frequently if a user is online).
- [ ] **Task 4.3: Integration Testing**
  - • Write integration tests for the EAS polling mechanism.
  - • Ensure that new attestations are detected and stored correctly with appropriate status updates.

---

## 5. GraphQL Proxy Implementation

- [ ] **Task 5.1: Define GraphQL Schema & Resolvers**
  - • Use Ariadne or Graphene to create a GraphQL schema that mirrors the functionality of the REST API.
  - • Implement resolvers that proxy requests to the underlying REST endpoints or directly call service layer functions.
- [ ] **Task 5.2: Integration & Testing**
  - • Integrate the GraphQL endpoint into the FastAPI application.
  - • Write tests to verify GraphQL queries and mutations.
- [ ] **Task 5.3: Documentation**
  - • Update API documentation to include GraphQL usage instructions.

---

## 6. Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] **Task 6.1: Implement Web3 Sign-In**
  - • Integrate a Web3 sign-in mechanism (e.g., "Sign in with Ethereum") into the authentication flow.
  - • Ensure that authenticated users can securely access private endpoints.
- [ ] **Task 6.2: Role-Based Access Control**
  - • Implement role-based access controls to manage public vs. private proofs.
  - • Write tests to ensure proper enforcement of permissions.
- [ ] **Task 6.3: Documentation & API Security**
  - • Document the authentication and authorization flow in the README.
  - • Review security configurations and update the Implementation Plan accordingly.

---

## 7. Final Integration, Testing & Deployment

- [ ] **Task 7.1: End-to-End Testing**
  - • Write comprehensive end-to-end tests covering REST, GraphQL, and authentication flows.
  - • Ensure the system passes OGC API compliance tests.
- [ ] **Task 7.2: CI/CD Finalization**
  - • Refine the CI/CD pipeline to deploy to AWS (using ECS/Fargate, RDS, etc.) on merge to the production branch.
  - • Test the deployment process in a staging environment.
- [ ] **Task 7.3: Documentation & Rollback Plan**
  - • Finalize and update all documentation (README, API docs via MkDocs, etc.).
  - • Create a rollback plan in case of deployment issues.

---

## 8. Ongoing Maintenance & Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Task 8.1: Monitor & Log**
  - • Set up logging (integrate with AWS CloudWatch) to monitor API performance and errors.
- [ ] **Task 8.2: Scheduled Reviews**
  - • Plan periodic reviews of the codebase and database schema for potential improvements.
- [ ] **Task 8.3: Extend Features**
  - • Based on user feedback, plan future enhancements (e.g., geospatial analytics, new authentication methods, etc.).
